Given an array with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i] <= array[i + 1] holds for every i (1 <= i < n).

Example1:

```
Input: [4,2,3]
Output: True
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
```

Example2:

```
Input: [4,2,1]
Output: False
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.
```

Note: 

The n belongs to [1, 10,000].


# Solution
## Approach 3: Locate and Analyze Problem Index [Accepted]
### Intuition

Consider all indices pp for which `A[p] > A[p + 1]`. If there are zero, the answer is True. If there are 2 or more, the answer is False, as more than one element of the array must be changed for `A` to be monotone increasing.

At the problem index `p`, we only care about the surrounding elements. Thus, immediately the problem is reduced to a very small size that can be analyzed by casework.

### Algorithm

As before, let `p` be the unique problem index for which `A[p] > A[p + 1]`. If this is not unique or doesn't exist, the answer is False or True respectively. We analyze the following cases:

+ If `p = 0`, then we could make the array good by setting `A[p] = A[p + 1]`.
+ If `p = len(A) - 2`, then we could make the array good by setting `A[p + 1] = A[p]`.
+ Otherwise, `A[p - 1]` `A[p]` `A[p + 1]` `A[p + 2]` all exist, and:
  + We could change `A[p]` to be between `A[p - 1]` and `A[p + 1]` if possible, or;
  + We could change `A[p + 1]` to be between `A[p]` and `A[p + 2]` if possible.
